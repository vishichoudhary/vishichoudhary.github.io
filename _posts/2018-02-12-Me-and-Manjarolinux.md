# Me and Manjaro linux

So, it was the time of mid july 2017 when I was getting bored using Ubuntu Linux (no offense). I was looking for any alternatives then.<br>
I tried on various distros like Debian, Fedora and many other but they seemed not a good fit for me.<br>
Then I came to know about Rolling Release Development Model, and seriously it's something that just enough to make me switch my OS.<br>
Then the googling begin about RRDM based os, got to know about Arch, Manjaro, BlackArch and many other.<br>
I was afraid to try Arch linux (thanks to many blog, memes). I thought to try Manjaro, downloaded it and while installation I got stucked with an unsuccessful install and i messed up things. Had to format my entire hard drive. Not complaining but I wanted to format, just putting my blame on that installation ;).<br>
Than I made my heart to try Arch Linux (Hey, you like challenges, my mind said) and was successful to install by putting my whole day into it. And then installing graphic-card drivers and while installing xorg I don't know what happened, I messed up again. I had already wasted my 2-3 days in OS switchings.<br>
And couldn't afford to waste more, I just switched back to Ubuntu... lol (fugitive, my mind said). This time I ignored my mind. And thought not to waste my remaining summers vacations I started working.<br>
During the ending of vacations I thought of giving Arch one more chance. This time I succeeded. Wohoo finally. I really enjoyed Arch Linux, and used it for almost 7-8 months. And one day I was trying to do a system upgrade and messed it up. Firefox was not working. I searched a lot and found out that each app makes a clone of itself while running and two clones kills each other. I didn't know why (may be they were out of resources).<br> 
Then I installed manjaro linux along side Arch. It's pretty good, i mean it's seriously pretty. Everything works out of the box. Gives me the power of RRDM. Looks elegant and cool. I am really in love with it. Graphic-drivers and other utilities works out of the box. What else you want hnn? Power of Arch and a great support.<br>
I really wanna recommend you to go and try it out.<br>
