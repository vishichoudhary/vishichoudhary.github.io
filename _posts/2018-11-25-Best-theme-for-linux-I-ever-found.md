title: Best theme for linux ?
tags: [linux, gui]
---

I have been using linux from quite a long period of time and seriously I am not very much fond of Linux GUIs.

Gnome is the only GUI I like and use. And it looks ugly.

So one day I was just looking for some nice themes and seriously after looking too hard I found nothing. 

One day I saw a screenshot on reddit which is taken from gnome and it looks really nice. 

I asked the user for the Apperance setting, which are followings:
{% highlight js %}

*Adapta-Eta-Maia* for Applications

*Xcursor-breeze-snow* for Cursor 

*Papirus-Dark* for Icons

*Adapta-Nokto-Eta* for Shell

{% endhighlight js %}

If you are looking for some theme change, I suggest you to have a look at these. :-)
