Hi, I am `Vishal Choudhary`, a Computer Science Student at NITH.

Currently i m final year student. 

I love to code, listen music, i am a folk song lover. Also I love to play computer games, I have completed my adventures games like all the part of resident evil(BioHazards), GTA, many others.
Recently I have switched to competitive games like CS:GO, PUBG (PC one), which you play from steam, not that fucking mobile pubg(That game is shit, I agree). Once I will become rich I will buy COD blackout, A RTX 20X graphics card and will play all the time.

I like to spend time on my pc doing stuff related to either python, linux or related to some automating scripting.

Topics that fascinate me are concurrency, parrellelism. Anything related to async programming. 

This is my blog, Hope you like this :-)
